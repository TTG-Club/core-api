    "description": "Aasimars are mortals who carry a spark of the Upper Planes within their souls. Whether they are descendants of angelic beings or individuals bestowed with celestial power, they can ignite this spark to bring light, healing, and heavenly wrath. Aasimars can appear in any mortal settlement. They resemble their parents but live up to 160 years and have features hinting at their celestial origins, such as metallic freckles, glowing eyes, a halo, or skin in angelic colors (silver, opal green, or copper red). These traits gradually manifest, becoming evident as the aasimar learns to fully embrace their divine nature."
